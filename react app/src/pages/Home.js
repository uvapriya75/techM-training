    <h1>Welcome to Diet Planner</h1>
    <h2>A balanced diet supplies the nutrients your body needs to work effectively. 
        Without balanced nutrition, your body is more prone to disease, infection, fatigue, and low performance.
        Children who don’t get enough healthy foods may face growth and developmental problems, poor academic performance, and frequent infections.
        They can also develop unhealthy eating habits that may persist into adulthood.
        Without exercise, they’ll also have a higher risk of obesity and various diseases that make up metabolic syndrome, such as type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure.
        According to the Center for Science in the Public Interest, 4 of the top 10 leading causes of death in the United States are directly linked to diet.</h2>
